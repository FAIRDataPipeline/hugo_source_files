# Installation
The remote registry is a (django)[https://www.djangoproject.com/] REST API and can easily be installed on any server which meets the following requirements.

## Pre-requisites
To install a remote registry you will require the following:

A server caple of running a webserver with the following installed:

### [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
Available through package managers such as `apt`, `brew` or `chocolatey`

### [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
With `pip` and the `venv` module installed.
Available through package managers such as `apt`, `brew` or `chocolatey`

### A database
Such as `PostgreSQL`(recommended), `MariaDB`, `MySQL`, `Oracle`, `SQLite` (not recommended for production). Full database support can be found on the [django site](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/databases/)

N.B. You may also need to install the corresponding database connector

### [`Graphviz`](https://graphviz.org/)
`Graphiz` is needed to create provernance reports, full installations instructions can be found on the [`Graphviz` site](https://graphviz.org/download/)

### An S3 Object Storage
This can be and S3 capible storage e.g. [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html), [Openstack](https://www.openstack.org/) or [Minio](https://min.io/)

If you are self hosted we would recommend using [Minio](https://min.io/)

## Installation on a Debian based system e.g. Ubuntu
This installation guide will focus on debian based systems but can be easily adapted.

### Step 1. Clone the repository
Clone the dataregistry repository using `git`

```
git clone https://github.com/FAIRDataPipeline/data-registry.git
```

### Step 2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment (`venv`) in the repository folder

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3. Install the `python` requirements

```
pip3 install -r local-requirements.txt
```
***N.B.*** the local requirements match the remote requirements

### Step 4. Generate a secret key

```
python3 -c 'from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())'
```

### Step 5. Edit drams/settings.py
The `settings.py` file within the `drams` folder should be modified to match your requirements.

#### Add your secret key
The secret key you generated in the previous step can either be added directly to the `settings.py` file:

```
SECRET_KEY = '<generated secret key>'
```
**N.B** If you do this remember to remove the following lines:
```
with open('/home/ubuntu/secret_key.txt') as f:
    SECRET_KEY = f.read().strip()
```

Alternatively the secret key can be stored in a file and read. To do this edit the following line with the file path a text file containing your secret key:
```
with open('/home/ubuntu/secret_key.txt') as f:
    SECRET_KEY = f.read().strip()
```

#### Edit `ALLOWED_HOSTS`

Add your domain to `ALLOWED_HOSTS` replacing `data.fairdatapipeline.org`

#### Edit `DATABASES`
The `databases` dictionary (fields) should be modified to contain a single `default` database containing the following fields:
`ENGINE` the engine for your database see the [django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/databases/) for more details.
`NAME` the database names
`USER` username of a user with read and write access to the database
`PASSWORD` password of the above user
`HOST` domain or ip of the database server
`PORT` port the databas is running on

#### Edit `BUCKETS`
The `BUCKETS` dictionary should be modified to contain a single `default` S3 bucket containing the following fields:

`url` the fully qualified URL of the S3 server e.g. `https://s3.domain.com:port/`, the port is optional if not running on the default port. For AWS the endpoint URL for different regions can be found in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html)

`bucket_name` the name of the bucket

`access_key` access key to bucket belonging to a user with read and write access

`secret_key` matching secret key to the above

`duration` how long urls generated for the bucket should be valid for in seconds (default: 600)


#### Set Up Authentication
The remote registry is designed to be authenticated with GitHub or GitLab OAuth, to do this you need to create either a [GitHub OAuth App](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app) or a [GitLab Oauth application](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html).

To configure these you will need the following callback URLs
**GitHub:**
```
<registry_url>/complete/github/
```
**GitLab:**
```
<registry_url>/complete/gitlab/
```
Where `<registry_url>` is the fully qualified url of the registry e.g. `https://data.fairdatapipeline.org`

Once the application has been setup the following fields will need to be added to settings.py:

**GitHub:**
```
SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_KEY = '<key>'
SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET = '<secret>'
AUTH_METHOD = "GitHub"
```
Replacing the key and secret from the GitHub OAuth App.

**GitLab:**
```
SOCIAL_AUTH_GITLAB_SCOPE = ['api']
SOCIAL_AUTH_GITLAB_KEY = '<key>'
SOCIAL_AUTH_GITLAB_SECRET = '<secret>'
AUTH_METHOD = "GitLab"
```
Replacing the key and secret from the GitLab OAuth Application

**N.B. if you are running your own instance of GitLab, you will also need to add the following field:
```
SOCIAL_AUTH_GITLAB_API_URL = 'https://example.com'
```
Where `https://example.com` is the full url to your GitLab domain adding the port if not running on the default port e.g. `https://example.com:1234`

### Authenticating Users
With the above authentication, by default anyone with an account on the given provider can login to the data registry.

**To restrict access:**
The registry can accept a yaml file containing users which are allowed to log into the registry. To do this create a yaml file containing the following:
```
username: GitHub Username [required string]
email: email address [optional string]
fullname: Full Name [required string]
orgs: organisation names [optional array]
```

Then add the following field to the `settings.py` file with full path to the yaml file:
```
AUTHORISED_USER_FILE = 'authorised_users/authorised_users.yaml'
```
an example of this yaml file is located on the [FAIRDataPipeline/authorised_users repository](https://github.com/FAIRDataPipeline/authorised_users/blob/main/authorised_users.yaml)

### Step 6: Initialise the registry
The registry should now be initialised, to do this run the following commands from the folder where you cloned the registry:
```
source venv/bin/activate
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="drams.settings"
export DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME=admin
export DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=password
export FAIR_USE_SUPERUSER="True"
cd scripts
chmod +x rebuild.sh
./rebuild.sh
```
Replacing `admin` and `password` with your desired superuser account.

### Step 7: Configure the Service using gunicorn
Create the following files: 

**`/etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.socket`**
```
[Unit]
Description=gunicorn socket

[Socket]
ListenStream=/home/ryan/data-registry/gunicorn.sock

[Install]
WantedBy=sockets.target
```
Replacing `/home/ryan/data-registry/` with the directory where you cloned the git repository

**`/etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service`**
```
[Unit]
Description=gunicorn daemon
Requires=gunicorn.socket
After=network.target

[Service]
User=ryan
Group=ryan
WorkingDirectory=/home/ryan/data-registry
Environment="DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=drams.settings"
ExecStart=/home/ryan/data-registry/venv/bin/gunicorn \
          --access-logfile - \
          --workers 3 \
          --bind unix:/home/ryan/data-registry/gunicorn.sock \
          drams.wsgi:application

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Again replacing both instances of `/home/ryan/data-registry/` with the directory where you cloned the git repository

#### Enable and Start the Service
Run the following commands to enable and run the data registry service
```
sudo systemctl start gunicorn.socket
sudo systemctl enable gunicorn.socket
```

### Step 8: Configure a reverse proxy with nginx
Edit or add a site to your nginx sites-enabled (for this example we will use the default site at `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`). If you choose to add a site, remember to symlink the file to the sites-available directory.
```
server {

    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server;

    location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
    location /static/ {
        root /home/ryan/data-registry;
    }

    location / {
        include proxy_params;
        proxy_pass http://unix:/home/ryan/data-registry/gunicorn.sock;
    }
}
```
Replacing both instances of `/home/ryan/data-registry/` with the directory where you cloned the git repository

**N.B.** for multisite nginx servers you should add the server name to the file e.g.
```
server_name data.fairdatapipeline.org;
```

Finally restart nginx:
```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

You may also need to install and SSL certificate, which can be done using [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=nginx&os=ubuntufocal).
